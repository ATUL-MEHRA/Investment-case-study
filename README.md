# Investment-case-study
# Spark Funds, an asset management company,  wants to understand global trends in investment and identify few companies to invest in .  Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments: 
• It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment 
• It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in 
 
The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the best sectors and countries are the ones where most investments are happening. In order to achieve the objective, we will follow a three step analysis approach:
• Investment Type Analysis: Understanding investments in venture, seed/angel, private equity categories, etc. so Spark Funds can decide which type is best suited for its strategy.
• Country Analysis: Understanding which English-speaking countries have had the most investments in the past. These will be Spark Funds’ favourites as well. 
• Sector Analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors


Conclusion:

Considering the following constraints for investment
• Investment between 5 to 15 million USD 
• Investment in English-speaking countries 
 
We recommend Spark Funds 
• Best suited type of investment - “Venture” 
• Best suited Countries and sectors for investment
